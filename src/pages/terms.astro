        <div class="legal-section">
          <h2>5. USER-GENERATED CONTENT</h2>
          <p>
            Users may create content within the App, including messages, squad requests, and profile information ("User Content").
          </p>
          <p>
            You retain ownership of your User Content. However, by submitting User Content through the App, you grant Lobbi a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, and sublicensable license to host, store, reproduce, display, and process such content solely for the purpose of operating, maintaining, and improving the App.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lobbi reserves the right to remove or restrict User Content that violates these Terms or applicable law.

        <div class="legal-section">
          <h2>6. MATCHING, INTERACTIONS, AND ASSUMPTION OF RISK</h2>
          <p>
            Lobbi facilitates discovery, matching, and communication between users based on self-reported preferences and activity.
          </p>
          <p>Lobbi does not guarantee:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>That users will receive matches;</li>
            <li>Compatibility or shared interests;</li>
            <li>The conduct, intent, or safety of other users.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            You acknowledge that all interactions occur at your own risk, and Lobbi is not responsible for offline or online interactions between users.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="legal-section">
          <h2>7. PARENT SHIELD FEATURE (INFORMATIONAL ONLY)</h2>
          <p>
            Lobbi offers an optional feature known as Parent Shield, which allows users who identify as parents to optionally indicate general age ranges of their children.
          </p>
          <p>Parent Shield:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Is entirely optional;</li>
            <li>Is self-reported and not verified;</li>
            <li>Collects only age ranges, not personal or identifying information about children;</li>
            <li>Exists solely to reflect personal preferences within the App.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Lobbi does not provide parental monitoring, child safety services, or verification of parental status. Parent Shield should not be interpreted as a safety feature or assurance of suitability.

          <h2>8. ACCOUNT SUSPENSION AND TERMINATION</h2>
          <p>
            Lobbi may suspend or terminate your account at any time, with or without notice, if you violate these Terms, provide false information, or engage in conduct that threatens the integrity of the platform or community.
          </p>
          <p>
            Users may delete their accounts at any time through in-app settings. Account deletion results in the removal of associated data as described in the Privacy Policy.
